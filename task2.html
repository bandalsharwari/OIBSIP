			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren) in a Bengali family in Calcutta. 
                 His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court.Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and 
                 Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five.
                 His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty 
                 controlling him.
                In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until
                 his family moved to Raipur in 1877. 
                In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination.
                In 1881, Narendra first met<b> Ramakrishna </b>, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884.

			<h2>Legacy</h2>
			<p>He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and 
                bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion. Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago,
                 where he began his famous speech with the words,<b><u>"Sisters and brothers of America...,"</u></b> before introducing Hinduism to Americans.He was so impactful 
                 at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament".
                 After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe,
                  disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of
                   Northern California),
                both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.
